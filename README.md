# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 13 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 13 applications: a missing `return` statement in a page component.

## Description

In Next.js, page components must return a JSX element.  Forgetting to include a `return` statement will result in a runtime error.

This example shows a `pages/about.js` file that lacks a `return` statement.  The application will crash when attempting to navigate to this page.

## Solution

The solution is simple: add a `return` statement to the component, returning valid JSX.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/missing-return-nextjs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd missing-return-nextjs
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

You can then reproduce the error and observe the fix.
